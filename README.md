# Problem Statement / Business Objective:
The bank aims to understand key factors that influence customer acceptance of credit card offers. By building a predictive model, the bank seeks to:

1. Improve targeted marketing by identifying customer characteristics linked to offer acceptance.
2. Enhance customer insights for tailoring products and services.
3. Maximize credit card revenue by increasing offer acceptance.
4. Answer key business questions related to demographics and financial behaviors.

The results and insights provided by this project will help the bank optimize customer acquisition, reduce marketing costs, and increase profitability in its credit card segment.

# Work Flow

This project was completed in three parts: SQL, Python, and Tableau. Each part focused on a specific aspect of data analysis, ranging from data extraction and manipulation to machine learning modeling and visualization.

## SQL
In the SQL part, we used SQL to explore, manipulate, and analyze a dataset. The tasks included creating and querying tables, applying various SQL functions, joining multiple tables, and utilizing aggregate functions to derive insights from the data. We also made use of subqueries to perform more complex data retrieval. The focus was on understanding how relational databases work, and how to extract meaningful information using SQL queries.

### Key Concepts:
- Writing basic SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Using JOINS to merge data from multiple tables
- Applying aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`
- Filtering data with `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses
- Grouping and sorting data using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`
- Using subqueries for advanced data retrieval

## Python
In the Python part, we worked on data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. After cleaning and transforming the dataset using Pandas, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns. We then built a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict outcomes based on the dataset. The project also included visualizations to help interpret the results.

### Key Concepts:
- Data manipulation with Pandas (reading files, cleaning, merging)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics
- Logistic Regression for machine learning modeling
- Data visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Handling missing or inconsistent data and outlier detection

## Tableau
In the Tableau part, we focused on creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the insights derived from the data analysis and machine learning model. The Tableau dashboard allowed for dynamic exploration of the data and provided a visual representation of key insights and trends.

### Key Concepts:
- Designing and building interactive dashboards
- Creating various chart types (bar, line, pie, maps)
- Applying filters and parameters for dynamic data exploration
- Using calculated fields to enhance insights
- Storytelling with data and designing effective visualizations
